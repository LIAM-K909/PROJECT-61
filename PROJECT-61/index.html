    <section id="about">
      <p>MY FAVOURITE HOBBY IS PROGRAMMING.Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

            <p> I KNOW SEVERAL PRIOGRAMMING LANGUAGES LIKE C++, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, HTML, PYTHON. BUT MY FAVOURITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS PYTHON, AND THE BEST PLATFORM FOR PYTHON PROGRAMMING IS VISUAL STUDIO CODE, AND GEANY IDE.
                THE FOLLOWING ARE THE LINKS TO DOWNLOAD THEM.
                GEANY: <a class="article"https://www.geany.org></a>

              I LOVE CODING AND I LEARN CODING IN WHITEHAT JR. MY TEACHER IS VERY TALANTED AND GUIDES ME TO DEVELOPE MY PASSION. SHE HAS ANSWERS TO ALL MY QUESTIONS. SHE ALWAYS INSPIRES ME.
              I ALSO LEARN PYTHON. I SEE TUTORIALS OF TOKYOEDTECH AND LEARN PYTHON.
